            <p>With a population exceeding 39 million, California proudly holds the title of the most populous state in the United States. Officially admitted to the Union on September 9, 1850, California boasts a rich and diverse history that has shaped its global identity. The state capital, Sacramento, lies in Northern California, strategically located in the heart of the Central Valley.</br>
        California’s vast expanse includes a wide variety of landscapes, from its bustling urban centers to serene coastal towns and agricultural heartlands. Known for its innovation, arts, and entertainment, California's economy ranks as one of the largest in the world, driven by industries such as technology, agriculture, and tourism. The state's average income level is higher than the national average, showcasing its role as an economic leader not just in the U.S., but globally.</br>
        The state's identity is one of balance: offering coastal beauty, mountainous terrains, and thriving metropolitan areas like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Sacramento; its capitol. From iconic national parks like Yosemite to groundbreaking cultural trends, California represents the cutting edge of modern America while holding true to its deep-rooted history and traditions.</p>

    <aside>California is called "The Golden State" because of its rich history and natural beauty. The nickname originally came from the Gold Rush in 1849, when people from all over the world came to California hoping to strike it rich. But the state’s connection to gold goes beyond just that event. The golden poppy, which is the state flower, blooms all over California during the spring, covering fields in bright golden colors. Even the sunsets along the coast seem to glow with a golden light. Plus, California has a thriving economy and is known for its agriculture, tech industry, and entertainment, all of which contribute to its "golden" reputation. Overall, "The Golden State" symbolizes both the natural beauty and the opportunities that California offers.</aside>
